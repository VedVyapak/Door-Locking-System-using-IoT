# Door-Locking-System-using-IoT

In this project, we propose a smart digital door locking system for home automation. This door locking system will send message directly to the mobile phone once any door or window is opened. In our proposed system, a NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is connected with a magnetic switch sensor. A door locking system proposed here consists of magnetic switch that will work as a magnetic sensor and will be fixed to the door, a Wi-fi Module that will send the notification directly to the phone once door is opened and Blynk app installed in phone that will receive the signal and displays the notification in phone. As the door lock is the first and last thing people come across in entering and leaving the home respectively, the notification sends in mobile phone in door locking system enables user to conveniently control and monitor door or window all at once before entering or leaving the house. Furthermore, it also allows users to remotely monitor the condition of door through Internet or any other public network. The biggest advantage of our proposed system over existing ones is that it can be easily installed when and where necessary without requirement of any infrastructures and proper planning.
